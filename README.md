# Gravity-Bookstore-
Building a Data Warehouse Model with Microsoft ETL for Power BI Analysis

## Project Description
The Gravity Bookstore project aims to design and implement a comprehensive data solution for capturing, analyzing, and visualizing crucial information regarding books, customers, and sales transactions.
###  key components:
1)Data Warehouse Construction:
  *Design and implement a robust data warehouse architecture to effectively store and manage data pertaining to books, customers, 
    and orders.
  *Utilize Microsoft ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools for seamless data integration from various sources into the data 
    warehouse.

2)Data Cubes Development:
  *Develop data cubes tailored for analyzing sales orders and customer data, enabling multidimensional analysis and insights 
    generation.
  *Utilize OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) techniques to facilitate efficient querying and exploration of the data.

3)Dashboard Development:
  *Design and implement an intuitive dashboard interface for easy access and visualization of key business metrics and 
     performance indicators.
  *Leverage Power BI, a powerful data visualization tool, to create interactive and visually compelling dashboards that provide 
     actionable insights.


The project commenced with the construction of a data warehouse using SQL Server and employed SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for structured data gathering, effectively organizing data related to books, customers, and sales. Subsequently, data cubes were crafted utilizing SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) in tabular mode, facilitating in-depth analysis of order patterns and customer interactions. Lastly, a user-friendly Power BI dashboard was developed, seamlessly integrating insights gleaned from the data warehouse and cubes to facilitate effortless monitoring and enhancement of business performance.
